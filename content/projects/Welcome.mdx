PelicanFlow is a grasshopper PythonScript Project launched since 2024.
It contains three packages that aims at simplify and automize the daily production in architecture and urban planning industry.

1. PelicanFlow × Data

The first set of tool is featured by its excel-like data management workflow to simplify the overcomplicated datatree system in grasshopper. Also, its makes working back-and-force between rhino/grasshopper and excel easier and faster.

The main function include:
- Importing Excel/csv file as Table-like DataTree 
- Organizing Geometries with attached Attribute Data as Table-like DataTree 
- Combining/Join Table-like DataTree by Keyword
- View Table-like DataTree with Column/Row structure
- Group Table-like DataTree by chosen Catagory
- Write Table-like DataTree into Csv File

By combining these definitions with other built-in functions of grasshopper it can organize and visualize your design easier than before.

The Test Version will released soon!
Pleasefind documentation in other threads of this website.

2. PelicanFlow × Plotting

The next stage of PelicanFlow is about plot management. 
It accelerates the urban planners' daily production by assiting them to divide plot, generate road network from axises or deal with geographical difference etc.
More importantly,it uses 'plot' as the most important connecting objects that bridges between 'Massing' and 'Data'. By collecting information of 3D geometry within a plot, it generates development statistics per plot in a few seconds, which can also be combined with the tools from PelicanFlow×Data.

More information will realised in the coming months.

3. PelicanFlow × massing

The final stage of PelicanFlow aims at providing massing and building typology generation tool for urban designers.
It aims at providing massing secenarios on a large scale with rich variety and flexibility.

With the combination of these three sub-package, I hope PelicanFlow can make your daily production easier and fun!
If there is any bugs or issues encountered, please contact me with the information on contact page.
The full package will be gradually realised on Food4Rhino!
