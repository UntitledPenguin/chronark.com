**🎉 Welcome to PelicanFlow!**  
PelicanFlow is a Grasshopper PythonScript project launched in 2024. It includes three powerful packages designed to simplify and automate daily workflows in the architecture and urban planning industries.

### PelicanFlow × Data 📊(In Testing now)

The first toolset features an Excel-like data management workflow that simplifies the complex data tree system in Grasshopper. It also streamlines the process of working back and forth between Rhino/Grasshopper and Excel.

**Key features include:**

- 📥 Importing Excel/CSV files as table-like DataTrees
- 🗂 Organizing geometries with attached attribute data into table-like DataTrees
- 🔗 Combining and joining table-like DataTrees using keywords
- 👀 Viewing table-like DataTrees with a column/row structure
- 📑 Grouping table-like DataTrees by selected categories
- 💾 Exporting table-like DataTrees to CSV files

By integrating these tools with other built-in Grasshopper functions, PelicanFlow helps you organize and visualize your designs more efficiently than ever before.

_🚀 The test version will be released soon! Please find documentation in other threads on this website._

### PelicanFlow × Plotting 🏙️ ( Phase 2 )

The next stage of PelicanFlow focuses on plot management, accelerating urban planners' workflows. It assists with tasks such as dividing plots, generating road networks from axes, and addressing geographical variations. Most importantly, it uses "plot" as the central connecting element between "Massing" and "Data." By gathering information from 3D geometry within a plot, it generates development statistics for each plot in seconds, which can also be combined with tools from PelicanFlow × Data.

_📰 More information will be released in the coming months._

### PelicanFlow × Massing 🏗️( Phase 3 )

The final stage of PelicanFlow plans to provide tools for generating massing and building typologies for urban designers. It offers large-scale massing scenarios with a rich variety of options and flexibility. As a designer, you can focus more on fine-tuning parameters and experimenting with different typologies, rather than drawing or modeling everything from scratch.
