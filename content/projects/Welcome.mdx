**🎉 Welcome to PelicanFlow!**  

PelicanFlow is a Grasshopper PythonScript project launched by Jiaqi in August 2024. It includes three powerful packages designed to simplify and automate daily workflows in the architecture and urban planning industries.


### PelicanFlow × Data 📊(The Test Version 0.1 Released now!)

The first toolset features an Excel-like data management workflow that simplifies the complex data tree system in Grasshopper. It also streamlines the process of working back and forth between Rhino/Grasshopper and Excel.

**Key features include:**

- 📥 Importing Excel/CSV files as table-like DataTrees
- 🗂 Organizing geometries with attached attribute data into table-like DataTrees
- 🔗 Combining and joining table-like DataTrees by sharing columns/branches
- 👀 Viewing data tree in a tabular format 
- 📑 Grouping table-like DataTrees by selected categories or based on value
- 💾 Exporting table-like DataTrees to CSV files

_🚀 The test version is now on [GitHub](https://github.com/UntitledPenguin/PelicanFlow)! 

- Please find documentation in this [thread](https://pelicanflow.vercel.app/projects/Documentation):

- More tutorials and examples coming soon!

Step forward?

### PelicanFlow × Plotting 🏙️ 

The next stage of PelicanFlow plans to focus on plot management, accelerating urban planners' workflows. It assists with tasks such as dividing plots, generating road networks from axes, and addressing geographical variations. Most importantly, it uses "plot" as the central connecting element between "Massing" and "Data." By gathering information from 3D geometry within a plot, it generates development statistics for each plot in seconds, which can also be combined with tools from PelicanFlow × Data.

### PelicanFlow × Massing 🏗️

The final stage of PelicanFlow plans to provide tools for generating massing and building typologies for urban designers. It offers large-scale massing scenarios with a rich variety of options and flexibility. As a designer, you can focus more on fine-tuning parameters and experimenting with different typologies, rather than drawing or modeling everything from scratch.
